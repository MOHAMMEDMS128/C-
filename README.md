# C-
3 implementations of the Julia Set:
(i) a sequential version, (ii) a version using Intelâ€™s Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library and (iii) a version using OpenCL
The implementations will generate a 2 Dimensional arrays of pixels of the Julia Set for each version using C++ programming language. 
Each version of the Julia Set has been developed in a separate Visual Studio project to avoid any issues regarding the implementations of the Set.
